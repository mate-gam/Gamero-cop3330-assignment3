Parsing Data File
First I will read in the file.
Then I will parse the array by using the commas that separate the values
Then add the values to an according array so all of the First names will be in the
same array. The size of the array will be pre determined from another function
That will return the size of the array for each value.
Finally I will use a for loop to write to the output file using table format.
