Product Search using Json file
First I will read in the Json file and parse the file
then adding each category to a separate array like nameArray and priceArray
Then when the user inputs the product name it will try to find it in the nameArray
If the product is not there it will ask the user again and again until there is a
valid search.
Finally if the name if found in the nameArray I will print out the description of
that certain product.
